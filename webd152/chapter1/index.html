   <p>My preferred caffeinated beverage is dark roast coffee with a small amount of milk. I am currently drinking a coffee my mother got me from Papua New Guinea. It has a nice caramel sweetness that is really nice. It also has a very rich dark chocolate flavor that really hits the spot. I typically enjoy a couple of cups in the morning and then another cup in the afternoon before I pick up my son from school to add a little kick to the rest of the afternoon.</p>
